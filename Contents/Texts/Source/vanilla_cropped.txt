Units are divided into the[LF]
following three types:[LF]
    Player (blue)[Huff][LF]
    Enemy (red)[Huff][LF]
    Neutral (green)[Huff][LF]
Blue units are controlled by the[LF]
player. Red units are the enemy[Huff][LF]
units the player must defeat.[Huff][LF]
Red units will attack both blue[Huff][LF]
and green units, so be careful.[X]

## MSG_060E
Units take turns moving in[LF]
the following order:[LF]
    1. Player (blue)[LF]
    2. Enemy (red)[LF]
    3. Neutral (green)[X]

## MSG_060F
If a main character's Hit Points[LF]
are reduced to zero, the game[Huff][LF]
ends.[X]

## MSG_0610
The blue area that appears[LF]
when you select a unit is[Huff][LF]
its movement range. Place the[Huff][LF]
cursor on an enemy unit to see[LF]
its movement range.[X]

## MSG_0611
Mounted units can move again[LF]
after visiting homes or villages[LF]
if they have movement remaining.[LF]
This is most common among[Huff][LF]
cavaliers and pegasus knights.[X]

## MSG_0612
The red area that appears when[LF]
you select a unit is its[LF]
attack range. Place the cursor[LF]
on an enemy unit to see its[Huff][LF]
attack range.[X]

## MSG_0613
Each weapon type has its own[LF]
strengths and weaknesses.[Huff][LF]
Swords do well against axes.[LF]
Axes do well against lances.[LF]
Lances do well against swords.[LF]
This is called the[LF]
Weapon Triangle.[X]

## MSG_0614
Each type of magic has its own[LF]
strengths and weaknesses.[Huff][LF]
Light is strong against Dark.[Huff][LF]
Dark is strong against Anima.[Huff][LF]
Anima is strong against Light.[LF]
This is called the[LF]
Trinity of Magic.[X]

## MSG_0615
Some weapons are especially[Huff][LF]
effective against certain units.[LF]
These weapons will cause heavy[LF]
damage to those units. For[LF]
example, bows are particularly[LF]
effective against flying units.[Huff][LF]
The weapon icons in the combat[LF]
information window will glow[LF]
when your unit is facing an[Huff][LF]
enemy that is weak against[LF]
that weapon.[X]

## MSG_0616
Critical hits inflict three times[Huff][LF]
the normal damage to enemies.[Huff][LF]
Your chance of a critical strike[LF]
changes depending on your unit's[LF]
attributes and the weapon with[LF]
which you are attacking.[X]

## MSG_0617
Any attack from a weapon is a[Huff][LF]
physical attack. Each unit's[LF]
DEF (defense) attribute[Huff][LF]
shows how well he defends[Huff][LF]
against physical attacks. The[Huff][LF]
higher the number, the less[Huff][LF]
damage he takes. Knights and[LF]
mercenaries have good defense.[X]

## MSG_0618
Any attack with magic is called[Huff][LF]
a magical attack. Your unit's[Huff][LF]
RES (resistance) attribute[LF]
shows how well he defends[Huff][LF]
against them. The higher the[LF]
number, the less damage he[LF]
takes. Mages, monks, clerics[LF]
& shamans have high resistance.[X]

## MSG_0619
Restore HP to your units by using[Huff][LF]
vulneraries, elixirs, and staves.[Huff][LF]
Vulneraries and elixirs heal[LF]
only the user, while staves heal[LF]
only the units on whom they're[LF]
used. Choose your healing[Huff][LF]
items carefully in battle.[X]

## MSG_061A
There are five abnormal states[LF]
a unit can enter:[Huff][LF]
1. Sleep[LF]
(Asleep and unable to move)[Huff][LF]
2. Silence[LF]
(Unable to use magic or staves)[Huff][LF]
3. Poison[Huff][LF]
(Take continual damage)[Huff][LF]
4. Berserk[LF]
(Attack enemies and allies alike)[Huff][LF]
5. Petrify[LF]
(Turned to stone, cannot move)[LF]
These conditions will continue for[LF]
several turns. They can be[LF]
reversed with a Restore staff.[X]

## MSG_061B
Here is the information shown if[LF]
you choose the strategic[LF]
combat information window:[LF]
[LF]
HP: Unit's remaining HP.[LF]
MT: Amount of damage the[LF]
equipped weapon inflicts.[Huff][LF]
HIT: Chance an attack will land.[LF]
CRIT: Chance the weapon will[LF]
land a critical blow.[X]

## MSG_061C
Here is the information shown if[LF]
you choose the detailed[Huff][LF]
combat information window:[LF]
[LF]
HP: Unit's remaining HP.[LF]
ATK: Amount of damage your[LF]
attack will inflict.[LF]
DEF: Amount of damage enemy[Huff][LF]
attacks will be reduced by.[Huff][LF]
HIT: Chance an attack will land.[LF]
CRIT: Chance the weapon will land[Huff][LF]
a critical blow.[LF]
AS: The speed of each unit's[LF]
attack, which determines how[LF]
many attacks each unit makes.[X]

## MSG_061D
Any unit can rescue a blue or[Huff][LF]
green unit in an adjacent tile.[Huff][LF]
However, your constitution must[Huff][LF]
be higher than that of the unit[Huff][LF]
you're trying to rescue.[LF]
The rescuing unit suffers a[Huff][LF]
penalty in speed and skill,[Huff][LF]
but the rescued unit is[Huff][LF]
protected from attacks.[Huff][LF]
If a unit is about to lose all[LF]
of its HP, use the rescue[Huff][LF]
command to whisk it to safety.[X]

## MSG_061E
You can drop a rescued unit into[LF]
any adjacent tile. The dropped[LF]
unit will not be able to move[Huff][LF]
until the next turn.[X]

## MSG_061F
You can purchase items at[Huff][LF]
shops. You can also pick them[Huff][LF]
up by visiting villagers and[LF]
opening chests. Enemies[Huff][LF]
sometimes drop items when[Huff][LF]
they are defeated.[X]

## MSG_0620
Choose an item from the item[LF]
list and press the A Button[Huff][LF]
to use it. Items that cannot[LF]
be used by that unit will be[LF]
grayed out.[X]

## MSG_0621
You can trade items with units[LF]
in adjacent tiles. Select Trade[Huff][LF]
on the command menu, and then[Huff][LF]
select the unit with whom you[Huff][LF]
want to trade. Next, place the[LF]
cursor on the item you want to[LF]
take from the other unit's[LF]
inventory and press the A Button[LF]
to receive that item.[X]

## MSG_0622
Items have a limited number of[LF]
uses. Each time you use an item[Huff][LF]
its durability goes down. The[Huff][LF]
number next to an item indicates[LF]
how many times it can be used.[LF]
When that number reaches 0, the[Huff][LF]
item breaks and disappears.[Huff][LF]
Be careful not to let items drop[LF]
to 0 in the heat of battle.[X]

## MSG_0623
A supply convoy travels with[LF]
your main character. If you[Huff][LF]
move to a space adjacent your[Huff][LF]
supply convoy, you can trade[LF]
items with it. On the battle[LF]
preparation screen, you can[Huff][LF]
also buy and sell items at the[LF]
supply convoy. The convoy can[Huff][LF]
store up to 100 items for you.[X]

## MSG_0624
Move a unit onto an armory and[LF]
then choose Armory to buy[Huff][LF]
weapons. You can also sell[LF]
items you've collected here.[X]

## MSG_0625
Move a unit onto a shop and[Huff][LF]
then choose Shop to buy and[Huff][LF]
sell items, magic tomes, and[LF]
staves.[X]

## MSG_0626
Forests and mountains give[LF]
units additional cover. When[LF]
your units are in these tiles,[LF]
enemy hit percentages will be[Huff][LF]
reduced. When entering attack[Huff][LF]
range, try to stop in one of[LF]
these spaces.[X]

## MSG_0627
Any unit that ends its turn[Huff][LF]
on a fortress, castle gate,[Huff][LF]
gate, or throne will regain[Huff][LF]
some HP automatically at the[LF]
beginning of the next turn.[X]

## MSG_0628
Move a unit to a house to visit[Huff][LF]
the occupants of that house.[LF]
This is a good way of gaining[Huff][LF]

turn the battle in your favor.[LF]
Visit houses whenever you get[Huff][LF]
the opportunity.[X]

## MSG_0629

unit to join you.[X]

## MSG_0634

if you talk to them. Move a[Huff][LF]
character you think might know[LF]
that enemy unit into a space[LF]
adjacent to it to see if they[Huff][LF]
can talk.[Huff][LF]
Be careful! Enemy units will[LF]
continue to attack until you[LF]
talk to them! Try not to take[Huff][LF]
them out or be taken out before[Huff][LF]
you have a chance to chat.[X]

## MSG_0635

is at that location.[X]

## MSG_063D

placing the cursor on the[Huff][LF]
main character and pressing[Huff][LF]

up in level, characters become[LF]
stronger, more skilled, etc.[LF]
The highest level is level 20.[X]

sure to change classes. When[LF]
changing classes, you will be able[LF]
to choose between 2 classes.[LF]

win twice what you wagered.[Huff][LF]
If you lose, that unit will[Huff][LF]
be gone for good.[X]

## MSG_0644
You can escape from battles[Huff][LF]

The [ToggleRed]Tower of Valni[ToggleRed] has appeared to the[LF]
east of Castle Frelia on the world map.[Huff][A][LF]
Once held by Grado's troops, it has become[LF]
home to a host of [ToggleRed]dark creatures[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
Battling these monstrosities is a good [Huff][LF]
way for units to gain strength.[Huff][A][LF]
Try using the tower as a training area [Huff][LF]
to gain extra experience.[Huff][A][CR][LF]
Be aware: you cannot save your battle [LF]
preparations for tower skirmishes.[A][LF]

[ToggleRed]HP[ToggleRed] and the amount[Huff][LF]
of damage you will inflict.[Huff][A][LF]
Eirika should do [Huff][ToggleRed]7[Huff][ToggleRed] points,[LF]
and the enemy should do [ToggleRed]9[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
You see the [ToggleRed]x2[ToggleRed] next to[LF]
[ToggleRed]Mt[ToggleRed], right?[A][LF]
This indicates that you will[LF]
[ToggleRed]attack twice[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
Eirika is faster than her[Huff][LF]
opponent, so she can [Huff][ToggleRed]strike[LF]
twice[Huff][ToggleRed] in one turn.[Huff][A][LF]
So, with [Huff][ToggleRed]2 attacks of 7[LF]
points each[Huff][ToggleRed], Eirika will[Huff][LF]
do [Huff][ToggleRed]14 points[Huff][ToggleRed] of damage.[Huff][A][LF]
Now press the [ToggleRed]A Button[ToggleRed] to[Huff][LF]
[ToggleRed]attack[ToggleRed] the enemy.[Huff][A][X]

below [ToggleRed]HP[ToggleRed] and [Huff][ToggleRed]Mt[ToggleRed]?[Huff][A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Hit[Huff][ToggleRed] is the likelihood that[Huff][LF]
you will land your blow.[A][LF]
Eirika's [Huff][ToggleRed]Hit[Huff][ToggleRed] is 94, so she[LF]
has a 94 percent chance[Huff][LF]
of hitting the enemy.[Huff][A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Crit[ToggleRed], short for Critical, also[LF]
appears in this window.[Huff][A][LF]
This is the chance an attack[LF]
will be a lethal strike.[A][LF]
Eirika's [Huff][ToggleRed]Crit[ToggleRed] is 14, so she[LF]
has a 14 percent chance of[LF]
landing a killing blow.[Huff][A][LF]
Critical attacks do [ToggleRed]3 times[Huff][ToggleRed][LF]
the damage of a normal[LF]
attack.[Huff][A][LF]

The relationship between [Huff][ToggleRed]swords[ToggleRed], [ToggleRed]lances[ToggleRed],[Huff][LF]
and [ToggleRed]axes[ToggleRed] is called the [Huff][ToggleRed]weapon triangle[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Lances[ToggleRed] are strong against [ToggleRed]swords[ToggleRed].[Huff][LF]
[ToggleRed]Swords[ToggleRed] are strong against [ToggleRed]axes[ToggleRed].[Huff][LF]
[ToggleRed]Axes[ToggleRed] are strong against [ToggleRed]lances[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
In that last battle, the enemy commander,[Huff][LF]
Breguet, wielded a [Huff][ToggleRed]lance[Huff][ToggleRed], while the[Huff][LF]
Frelian soldier used a [Huff][ToggleRed]sword[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Lances[ToggleRed] are strong against [ToggleRed]swords[ToggleRed],[Huff][LF]
so Breguet had an advantage.[A][LF]
The [ToggleRed]weapon triangle[Huff][ToggleRed] can be very[LF]
important in determining the outcome of[Huff][LF]
a battle. For the time being, just[A][LF]
remember that [ToggleRed]lances[ToggleRed] are strong[Huff][LF]
against [ToggleRed]swords[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][X]

beginning of your turn.[Huff][A][LF]
Currently, the enemy commander, Breguet,[LF]
is standing on a [Huff][ToggleRed]gate[ToggleRed]. Even if he takes[LF]
damage, he'll soon [Huff][ToggleRed]recover some of the[Huff][ToggleRed][LF]
[ToggleRed]HP[ToggleRed] he lost.[Huff][A][X]

against [ToggleRed]axes[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
Seth is at an advantage.[A][X]

one of your [ToggleRed]allies[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
The green unit on the other side of the[Huff][LF]
mountains is Garcia. He is still [Huff][ToggleRed]neutral[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
If you get the right person to talk to[LF]
him, he may become an [ToggleRed]ally[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
Move into spaces adjoining green units[LF]
and select [Huff][ToggleRed]Talk[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][CR][LF]
Ross is Garcia's son. Move Ross into a[LF]
space next to Garcia and choose [ToggleRed]Talk[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][X]

## MSG_0980

bandit threat. First, place the cursor[LF]

the A Button.[Huff][A][X]

## MSG_0988
There is an [ToggleRed]armory[ToggleRed] due south of here.[Huff][A][LF]
You could probably take the [ToggleRed]red gem[Huff][ToggleRed] you[LF]
got at the village and sell it there.[Huff][A][X]

## MSG_0989
It's a good idea to buy iron swords and[Huff][LF]
other everyday weapons at [ToggleRed]armories[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
However, your funds are not endless.[A][LF]
There are [ToggleRed]armories[ToggleRed] in other towns, too,[Huff][LF]
so purchase only necessary items here.[A][X]

## MSG_098A
From here on out, you'll also have[LF]
the services of a [ToggleRed]supply convoy[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][LF]
The [ToggleRed]supply convoy[Huff][ToggleRed] always travels [LF]
with your commander.[A][LF]
The commander of this group is [Huff][ToggleRed]Eirika[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
If you place an allied unit in a space[LF]
next to [ToggleRed]Eirika[ToggleRed], the [ToggleRed]supply[ToggleRed] command[LF]
will display. You will then be able to[LF]
[ToggleRed]give[ToggleRed] and [Huff][ToggleRed]take[ToggleRed] items.[Huff][A][LF]
If you're carrying too many items,[LF]
it's a good idea to [ToggleRed]give[ToggleRed] some to[LF]
the [ToggleRed]supply convoy[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][X]

[ToggleRed]Walls[Huff][ToggleRed] with cracks in them can be[Huff][LF]
attacked and destroyed.[Huff][A][LF]
Once a wall is destroyed, you can pass[LF]
through the opening you've created.[Huff][A][LF]
When your way seems blocked, be sure[LF]
to check all the [Huff][ToggleRed]walls[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][X]

## MSG_099C
The bandits' [Huff][ToggleRed]hand axes[Huff][ToggleRed] can be used[LF]
in both [ToggleRed]direct[ToggleRed] and [Huff][ToggleRed]indirect combat[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
They can be wielded like normal axes[LF]
in direct, hand-to-hand combat[A][LF]
or thrown to strike enemies who are[Huff][LF]
a space away or at an angle to you.[Huff][A][LF]
Like bows, they can also hit enemies[LF]
on the [Huff][ToggleRed]other sides of walls[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][X]

## MSG_099D
The [ToggleRed]thief[Huff][ToggleRed] Colm has appeared.[Huff][A][LF]
Thieves can [ToggleRed]steal[Huff][ToggleRed] items from[Huff][LF]
other units.[A][LF]
Also, they can [Huff][ToggleRed]open the locks[ToggleRed] of[Huff][LF]
[ToggleRed]doors[Huff][ToggleRed] and [Huff][ToggleRed]chests[ToggleRed]. Thieves[Huff][LF]
are handy allies to have around.[A][X]

## MSG_099E
Place the cursor on a unit and press[LF]
the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed] to display that[LF]
unit's [Huff][ToggleRed]status[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
For example, if you select a bandit[Huff][LF]
and press the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed], you'll[LF]
see that he's carrying a hand axe.[A][CR][LF]
If you press the [Huff][ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed] again,[Huff][LF]
you'll see [Huff][ToggleRed]help information[ToggleRed] for each[Huff][LF]
item on-screen.[Huff][A][LF]
You can use the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed] to see[Huff][LF]
the properties of weapons and items.[A][LF]
If there's something you don't [Huff][LF]
understand about [Huff][ToggleRed]unit information[ToggleRed], [LF]
press the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][X]

## MSG_099F
Bows are [Huff][ToggleRed]ranged weapons[ToggleRed].[Huff][LF]
They can be used to attack enemies[LF]
who are a space away.[Huff][A][LF]
Additionally, they can be used[LF]
to attack over walls.[Huff][A][X]

## MSG_09A0
Colm and Neimi are childhood friends.[Huff][LF]
Try moving Neimi next to Colm and[Huff][LF]
have her [Huff][ToggleRed]talk[ToggleRed] to him. He[Huff][LF]
may decide to join you.[Huff][A][X]

## MSG_09A1
Colm and Neimi have an [Huff][ToggleRed]invisible[Huff][LF]
bond[ToggleRed] that ties them together.[Huff][A][LF]
Units that have such a bond can[Huff][LF]
develop a [ToggleRed]support relationship[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][CR][LF]
Units become closer and their bond[LF]
stronger the longer they are[LF]
[ToggleRed]adjacent to one another[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
Eventually, they will be able to[LF]
share a [ToggleRed]support conversation[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][CR][LF]
Units that share a support relationship[Huff][LF]
fight with [Huff][ToggleRed]improved abilities[ToggleRed][LF]
when they are near each other.[A][CR][LF]
There are three levels of support[Huff][LF]
units can share: [Huff][ToggleRed]C, B, and A[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
Levels are gained by staying[LF]
side-by-side as much as possible.[Huff][A][CR][LF]
Colm and Neimi are not the only units[Huff][LF]
that can have support relationships.[LF]
Eirika and Seth, among others, can [Huff][LF]
grow close to other units as well.[A][CR][LF]
Watch how characters interact with each[Huff][LF]
other to guess at who might share[Huff][LF]
a support relationship with whom.[Huff][A][CR][LF]
If you have two units you think may[Huff][LF]
have such a bond, [ToggleRed]place them next[Huff][LF]
to one another again and again[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
Who knows: they may eventually share[LF]
a [ToggleRed]support conversation[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][CR][LF]
However, bear in mind that each unit[LF]
can have only [ToggleRed]5[Huff][ToggleRed] support relationships.[Huff][A][X]

## MSG_09A2
Enemy units may sometimes drop items[LF]
when they are defeated.[Huff][A][LF]
In the same way you searched for hand[Huff][LF]
axes earlier, try looking at enemy items[LF]
with the [Huff][ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Green items[Huff][ToggleRed] are items that will be [LF]
dropped. Check enemy items beforehand [LF]
to gain the advantage in combat.[A][X]

There are three different schools of[LF]
[ToggleRed]magic[Huff][ToggleRed], each of which is governed[Huff][LF]
by the [Huff][ToggleRed]trinity of magic[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Light[Huff][ToggleRed] is strong against [Huff][ToggleRed]Dark[ToggleRed].[Huff][LF]
[ToggleRed]Dark[ToggleRed] is strong against [Huff][ToggleRed]Anima[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][LF]
[ToggleRed]Anima[Huff][ToggleRed] is strong against [Huff][ToggleRed]Light[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
For now, just remember that [ToggleRed]Light[Huff][LF]
is strong against Dark[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][X]

## MSG_09B7
The [ToggleRed]magic[Huff][ToggleRed] that Artur and Lute[LF]
wield cannot be stopped by[LF]
physical [Huff][ToggleRed]defense[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
However, magic [Huff][ToggleRed]resistance[ToggleRed] can affect[Huff][LF]
the damage it does.[Huff][A][LF]
So, it's possible to do high damage to[LF]
units like [Huff][ToggleRed]knights[Huff][ToggleRed], who possess[Huff][LF]
strong [Huff][ToggleRed]defenses[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
On the other hand, it's difficult to harm[Huff][LF]
units with high [ToggleRed]resistance[ToggleRed], like[LF]
pegasus knights.[A][LF]
Magic can also be used to attack[LF]
directly or indirectly, like a hand axe.[A][LF]
It can be wielded like a sword to strike[LF]
adjacent foes or like a bow to hit[LF]
enemies at a distance.[A][X]

## MSG_09B8
Starting on this map, you'll be able[LF]
to use the [Huff][ToggleRed]preparations screen[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
You can [ToggleRed]choose which units[ToggleRed] to send into[Huff][LF]
battle and [Huff][ToggleRed]manage items[ToggleRed] to secure[LF]
the best chance of victory.[Huff][A][X]

## MSG_09B9
Forests and other map areas may[Huff][LF]
offer [ToggleRed]terrain bonuses[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
Units in forests are harder to hit[LF]
and take less damage when struck.[Huff][A][LF]
Simply put, staying under trees makes[Huff][LF]
it more difficult for enemies to hit [Huff][LF]
and harm you.[Huff][A][LF]
Areas that have [ToggleRed]terrain bonuses[Huff][ToggleRed] are[LF]
[ToggleRed]forests[Huff][ToggleRed], [ToggleRed]mountains[Huff][ToggleRed], [ToggleRed]fortresses[ToggleRed], and[Huff][LF]
[ToggleRed]gates[Huff][ToggleRed], to name a few.[A][LF]
Use terrain to your advantage during[LF]
combat to avoid risking your units.[Huff][A][X]

Sometimes, you can talk to an enemy and[Huff][LF]
convince him to join you.[Huff][A][LF]
For example, right now, [ToggleRed]Joshua[ToggleRed] might[LF]
be inclined to talk with [Huff][ToggleRed]Natasha[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][CR][LF]
However, [Huff][ToggleRed]Joshua[ToggleRed] is a [ToggleRed]red unit[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
Unlike green units you've seen before,[LF]
he will [ToggleRed]attack[ToggleRed] until he's spoken to.[A][LF]
Moreover, [ToggleRed]Joshua[ToggleRed] is a [ToggleRed]myrmidon[ToggleRed], who[Huff][LF]
specializes in [Huff][ToggleRed]critical hits[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
If you are struck by a [Huff][ToggleRed]critical hit[ToggleRed], you[Huff][LF]
will suffer 3 times the normal damage.[A][LF]
It's a good idea to check [ToggleRed]Crit[ToggleRed][LF]
on the combat information window.[Huff][A][X]

## MSG_09D2
You got an armorslayer.[Huff][A][LF]
This weapon is similar to rapiers in[LF]
that you can severely injure knights[LF]
and generals with a single blow.[A][LF]
In such cases, the weapon icon on the[Huff][LF]
combat information window will flash.[Huff][A][X]

## MSG_09D3
There's an [Huff][ToggleRed]armory[ToggleRed] and a[LF]
[ToggleRed]shop[ToggleRed] in this city.[A][X]

## MSG_09D4
[ToggleRed]Armories[ToggleRed] sell iron swords, steel[LF]
lances, and other weapons.[A][LF]
[ToggleRed]Shops[Huff][ToggleRed] carry spells, vulneraries,[Huff][LF]
and a myriad of other items.[A][LF]
If you're running short on anything,[LF]
make sure you stock up here.[A][X]

## MSG_09D5
There's an [Huff][ToggleRed]arena[Huff][ToggleRed] here.[A][X]

## MSG_09D6
Arenas play host to [ToggleRed]one-on-one[LF]
combat matches[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
If you win a match, you'll earn [ToggleRed]twice[Huff][LF]
the amount of the entry fee[Huff][ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
If you lose, however, that unit [ToggleRed]will not[LF]
be able to fight in any future battles[ToggleRed].[Huff][A][LF]
If your HP drops near zero in a fight,[LF]
[ToggleRed]press the B Button quickly[ToggleRed] to concede.[A][LF]
You'll lose your entry fee, but you'll[LF]
save your unit to fight again.[A][X]
